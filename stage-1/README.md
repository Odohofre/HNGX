## Project Description

This is a simple webpage that showcases specific personal and real-time data attributes using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It includes the following elements:

- Slack Name
- Slack display picture
- Current day of the week
- Current UTC time
- Track
- Github URL for the project

Each element is identified by a `data-testid` attribute for easy identification and testing.
